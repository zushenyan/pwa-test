# PWA Test
An repo for demonstrating progressive web app.

# Start

Start a server for running this app. Here I use `http-server` as simple server. You can install that with command

```
$ npm install -g http-server
```

and let `http-server` start and serve `index.html` automatically by entering this command

```
$ http-server -c-1
```

This will server `index.html` on `localhost:8080` by default.

# Resource

Here's the resources I learned from when trying to build PWA app:

- [Your first PWA app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/#0)
- [Stuff I wish I'd known sooner about service workers](https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/fd6c3c73e6e707e312d7c5d7d0f3b2f9)
